## [Unreleased]

### Changed

-   `Dematerialize` in the Git provider also removes the object from the local Git LFS cache, so freeing a file frees its disk space. It first checks that the remote has that exact object, and it keeps the object when the repository uses a custom `lfs.storage` or has commits that are not pushed to `origin`. `Materialize` downloads it again.
-   For an HTTP(S) Git LFS server, `Dematerialize` checks the object with a dry run and downloads nothing. A local remote still copies the object once, because only a real fetch checks it.
-   `GetStatus` runs `git status` once. It used to run it a second time for the workspace version.
-   `Materialize` downloads a file's object with one `git lfs fetch` for that path and then checks the file out.

### Fixed

-   The Node runtime and lakeFS provider import Node modules as ES modules, so compiled output runs with plain `node` without a CommonJS bundle.
-   `GetStatus`, the word diff and the checks before `Materialize`, `Dematerialize`, `RestorePaths`, `Prune` and `Deduplicate` no longer stop after 30 or 120 seconds without output. Git prints nothing while it re-hashes a changed Git LFS file, so these failed for large files.
-   `Dematerialize` checks a file's hash without a time limit and reports the real reason when the check fails. A slow check of a large file used to fail as a mismatch.
-   `Materialize` runs `git lfs checkout` to completion. For a large file it used to hit a time limit and report a failure, while on Windows git-lfs kept running and held `.git/index.lock`.
-   `Materialize`, `Dematerialize` and picking a large-object conflict candidate work for file names with brackets, commas or other glob characters. git-lfs read such a name as a pattern that matched no file.
-   `Materialize` and `Dematerialize` report success when they finished, also when a cancel request arrived during their last step.
-   `Materialize` and `Dematerialize` pass the account credential to git-lfs, so they work on private repositories. The server used to answer 401.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-24

### Added

-   Added provider-neutral abstractions for workspace sessions and core version control. Optional services can be absent, with fallback wrappers for consumers that need a complete session.
-   Added a Git provider that runs Git and Git LFS through the git CLI.
-   Added a lakeFS provider.
-   Added the Node runtime and dependency-only umbrella package for coordinated provider installation.
-   Added Fable and .NET targets.
